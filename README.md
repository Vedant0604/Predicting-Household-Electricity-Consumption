Created a simple regression model to predict household electricity demand using historical
data and time features, inspired by Google DeepMindâ€™s large-scale energy forecasting.

Built and evaluated a linear regression model on electricity consumption data;
achieved an MAE of X kW using only basic features like time of day and previous
consumption
